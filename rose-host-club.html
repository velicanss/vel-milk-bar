	<h2>Chapter I: <span style="color: #b81f1f;">The Night of Cherry Avenue</span></h2> <hr>
	<img src="images/nvl1.jpg" alt="Cherry-Avenue" class="imgnvl">
	<p>It’s Sunday, February 9, in Dragnoia City. A so-called city of freedom—freedom for the rich, I guess. People like me? We get nothing. Not even a decent meal. They call this the city of opportunity, a place where every race is welcome, where fortune waits for anyone willing to work for it. So I left my homeland. to chase that promise. But… It was all a lie.</p>
	<p>The tall Wyvern clock tower stands proudly in the night of Dragnoia, its enchanted gears humming softly as it casts a long shadow over warm light emanating from the tavern, a paradise built on wealth. But it’s exclusively for the nobles, not a vagrant like me, the truth is different. I glance toward the Cherry Avenue and see a beggar curled against the wall, begging for mercy as a  group of young aristocrats corner him, laughing as they kick him for their twisted amusement, The guards stationed outside? They don’t even glance at that poor beggar.</p>
	<p>The air is thick with the stench of pollution from the potion factory and alcohol from the tavern. Those towering buildings? They exist only for the fatcats, the ones who feast while the rest of us starve. The rich don’t just step on the weak—they own us, and In Dragnoia, everything has a price. Even justice. Freedom. And even me.</p>
	<p>I’ve been here for a week and I'm fighting myself to survive, I don’t have any job, no money and to make it worse, I got robbed in the back alley like a bitch and left with nothing, not even a single copper coin.</em></p>
	<p>The cold air bites at my skin, sharp and unforgiving. My stomach barks like angry dogs. I haven’t eaten since yesterday. Swallowing my pride, I rummaged through the trash bin behind a family restaurant. Luck is all I have left.</p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“I… I can’t believe this”</em></p>
	<p>I’ve found a half eaten moldy bread, and well… you know what they’re saying a beggar can’t choose are they? And so I ate that stale bread like a rat, it tasted miserable.</p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“A week ago, I was just another broke immigrant looking for work. Now, I’m hunched over a dumpster, gnawing on moldy bread like a sewer rat. So this is what rock bottom tastes like”</em></p> 
	<p>But do I even had any choice to begin with? I can’t find a job since most places won’t take me in, not even as a lowly bar sweeper, and that fuckin robber took all of my money—stupid fuckin robber I hate this city I hate everything happen to me, why me? What did I do to even deserve this fate? I'm just a lowly vagrant nobody in god forsaken hellhole.<p>
	<p>I lash out, kicking a pile of trash, sending bottles shattering against the alley wall. My ragged breath clouds in the cold air as frustration coils tighter in my chest. “Why me? Why does my life feel like a punishment? Am I really that worthless?” Then, footsteps. A shadow looms over me—calm, deliberate woman figure.</p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“ugh, look at you. so~disgusting”</em></p>
	<p>She snapped, her hand rested on her hips as she look at me up and down like i'm some kind of an animal </p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“hmm… but you got a nice body, and that asshole look on your face tehee~ it must be my lucky day”</em></p>
	<p>She let out a laugh and tossed a fresh bag of bread at me, it feels like she laughed at my pathetic existence. The bread feels so warm, almost like hope.</p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“My name is Polina, and I own a host club at the end of this avenue. Say, do you want a job hmm???”</em></p>
	<p>Her tone quickly changes so softly, almost like an angel and then she waves a piece of contract in front of me.</p>
	<p style="color: #fff"><em>“You. A host. At the Rose Host Club?”</em></p>
	<p>My eyes skim the paper. Shelter, food, money—it all seems too good to be true. But then my gaze lands on one line.</p>
	<p><span style="color: #b81f1f;"><strong><em>'Never reject any client's desire.'</strong></em></span></p>
	<p>My gut tightens. It sounds more like a slave contract than a job offer. But… What choice do I have?.</p>
